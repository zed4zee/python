    "text": "I learnt coding and Python almost a year ago as part of my college course. It was a lot of fun. They key advice that my professor had given back then was, “Think of what you want to do next and keep working on projects!”, an advice that I regeret not taking. Months went by and coding drifted away from my life. I was not a regular coder and never really coded every single day for the past few months. This has resulted in a lot of gaps in my skills and at times I forget basic Python syntax. I Google stuff and try make things work in a very shallow manner.\nAs part of learning deep learning through the fast.ai course, I realized all these gaps. Most of the time, I struggled a lot reading and understanding Python code."
