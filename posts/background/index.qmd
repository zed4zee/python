![](bad_coder.jpg)

I learnt coding and Python almost a year ago as part of my college course. It was a lot of fun. They key advice that my professor had given back then was, "Think of what you want to do next and keep working on projects!", an advice that I regeret not taking. Months went by and coding drifted away from my life. I was not a regular coder and never really coded every single day for the past few months. This has resulted in a lot of gaps in my skills and at times I forget basic Python syntax. I Google stuff and try make things work in a very shallow manner.

As part of learning deep learning through the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) course, I realized all these gaps. Most of the time, I struggled a lot reading and understanding Python code.

## I want to change this!

I have decided to work on my coding and Python skills by re-learning it. Once I do that, I want to build a daily habit where I code every single day for atleast 2 hours to keep my skills sharp!

On this site, I document all of that. 

## From Where Am I Re-Learning

I have decided to repeat my college Python course. It was really great and I loved it. A hands-on approach blended with problem solving.

Apart from that I have some other books and resources that I will use. Will keep updated here as I go along.
