![](bad_coder.jpg)

I learnt coding and Python almost a year ago as part of my college course. It was a lot of fun. They key advice that my professor had given back then was, "Think of what you want to do next and keep working on projects!", an advice that I regeret not taking. Months went by and coding drifted away from my life. I was not a regular coder and never really coded every single day for the past few months. This has resulted in a lot of gaps in my skills and at times I forget basic Python syntax. I Google stuff and try make things work in a very shallow manner.

As part of learning deep learning through the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) course, I realized all these gaps. Most of the time, I struggled a lot reading and understanding Python code.

## I want to change this!

I have decided to work on my coding and Python skills by re-learning it. Once I do that, I want to build a daily habit where I code every single day for atleast 2 hours to keep my skills sharp!

On this site, I document all of that. 

## My Plan

### Phase 1

In the first phase I have decided to repeat my college Python course. It was really great and I loved it. It was highly practical. A hands-on style blended with problem solving.
 
The course was like this function, a black magic box. You go inside as a non-coder, and come out with brilliant skills.

All I did was go through the lectures, by firing up an IDE on the side, and coding as I went along. I coded for 3 months and after that I could see the changes.

So I will go through this process again.

### Phase 2 & Beyond

Once I am done with it, the next step would be to become a pro. Will keep updated on what to do as I go along. There are some advanced coding courses and books that I might pick and do at this stage, do some projects, etc. Or maybe the PDLC course will help me improve as I do deep learning. Let me plan this then.
